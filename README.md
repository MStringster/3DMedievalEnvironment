# 3DMedievalEnvironment

This is my portion of a university Group Assignment. To create an application with interactivity from the
Microsoft Kinect.

I was tasked with creating the graphical elements in the application. (Modelling and Rendering)

In our group we decided to create a medieval carnaval type game where the user can participate in different 
actvities via the kinect. Due to COVID-19 however the full product never came together.

This is all the code that I have personally written, the full running applciation requires loaders, THREE.js ver 125 and orbit controls.
